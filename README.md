# bhojan
Bhojan starts off with a photo page, where you can upload images of your menu. Using Azure's Compute APIs, which include the Read API, WordCorrect API, and their NLP models, Bhojan extracts menu items with their corresponding prices. At the same time, if the enterprise isn't listed on the database, they must fill in their inventory for the items on the menu. After this process is done, the data is fed into a database and the user is taken to the order page. Here, the user enters what they want to order and it is passed onto the restaurant. They are notified of the Delivery Process by SMS, using Twilio's APIs which are hosted on Azure function containers. Finally, they are given a confirmation page with their final order and total cost.
